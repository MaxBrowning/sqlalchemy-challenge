# sqlalchemy-challenge

This challenge analyzes climate data in Hawaii to help with trip planning. The project is split into two sections:
1. Climate Analysis & Exploration using Python and SQLAlchemy
2. Climate App using Flask

In a final flask application, analysts are able to see the full raw data on precipitation and stations. Additionally, analysts are able to drill into a specific date range to quickly see noteable precipitation data.
